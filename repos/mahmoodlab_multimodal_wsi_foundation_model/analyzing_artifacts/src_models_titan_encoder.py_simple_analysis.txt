Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/models/titan_encoder.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/models/titan_encoder.py).

It is analysis-only (no code), and it is aligned to:
- paper methodology,
- provided design interfaces (without adding public APIs),
- task constraints,
- and `config.yaml` values only (with unresolved supplementary hyperparameters kept explicitly unresolved).
