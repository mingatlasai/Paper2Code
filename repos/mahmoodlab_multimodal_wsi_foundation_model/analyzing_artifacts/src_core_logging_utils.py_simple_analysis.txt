Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [src/core/logging_utils.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/core/logging_utils.py)

It is analysis-only (no executable code), and it is aligned to:
- the paper methodology,
- your design interfaces (without adding/changing public APIs),
- and the provided `config.yaml` values only (including explicit handling of `null` hyperparameters).
