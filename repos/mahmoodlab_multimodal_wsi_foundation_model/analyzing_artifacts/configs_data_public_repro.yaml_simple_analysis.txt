Completed. I wrote the full logic analysis to:

[configs/data/public_repro.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/data/public_repro.yaml)

It is now structured as a config-driven implementation guide aligned to:
- the paper methodology,
- your fixed design/interfaces,
- the provided task list,
- and `config.yaml` as the source of truth (with unresolved values explicitly kept as unresolved/null-driven).
