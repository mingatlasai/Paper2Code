Implemented the requested logic analysis in [tests/test_losses.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/tests/test_losses.py).

It now contains a structured, paper/config-aligned test plan for:
- iBOT loss (`IBOTLoss`) contracts and edge cases,
- contrastive loss symmetry and mismatch behavior,
- caption CE padding/shape correctness,
- stage-2/3 weighted loss composition (including null-weight policy),
- AMP safety, determinism, and logging-key expectations.

No executable tests were added yet, only the analysis content as requested.
