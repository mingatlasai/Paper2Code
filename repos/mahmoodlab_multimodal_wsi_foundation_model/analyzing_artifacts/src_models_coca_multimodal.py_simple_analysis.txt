Added the requested logic analysis to [src/models/coca_multimodal.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/models/coca_multimodal.py).

It is fully aligned to the provided paper text, design interfaces, task constraints, and `config.yaml`, including:
- exact `CoCaModel` public API contracts from the design,
- stage-2/3 training logic (batching, data geometry, checkpoint flow),
- shared embedding/generation behavior for downstream eval,
- explicit handling of unresolved supplementary hyperparameters as configurable (not invented).
