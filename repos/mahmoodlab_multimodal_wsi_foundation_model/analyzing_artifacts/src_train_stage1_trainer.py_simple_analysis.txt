Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [src/train/stage1_trainer.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/train/stage1_trainer.py)

It is analysis-only (no code), and covers the stage-1 specifics you asked for: 16x16 crop/view policy (2x global 14x14 + 10x local 6x6), student-teacher/iBOT loss flow, teacher EMA timing, config-bound invariants, failure modes, and `titan_v.ckpt` export/handoff requirements.
