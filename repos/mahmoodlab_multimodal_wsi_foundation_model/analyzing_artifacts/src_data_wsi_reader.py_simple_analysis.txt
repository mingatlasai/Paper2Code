Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/data/wsi_reader.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/data/wsi_reader.py).

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned analysis covering:
- exact `WSIReader` interface constraints from the design,
- coordinate normalization (level-0 convention),
- 20x/mpp handling tied to `config.yaml`,
- method-by-method responsibilities and failure modes,
- downstream contracts with segmentation/tiling/feature extraction,
- reproducibility and testing implications,
- explicit handling of unspecified paper details without inventing values.

No executable code was added yet, only analysis content as requested.
