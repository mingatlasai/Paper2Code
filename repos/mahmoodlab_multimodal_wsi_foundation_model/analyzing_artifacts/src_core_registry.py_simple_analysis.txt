Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/core/registry.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/core/registry.py).

It now documents, in a paper- and config-aligned way, how the registry should:
- Register/create datasets, models, and trainers via the exact design interface.
- Enforce stage-safe wiring for Stage 1/2/3 and eval integration.
- Use only values from `config.yaml` (including null-handling for missing hyperparameters).
- Centralize dependency injection and validation to avoid hardcoded branching in `main.py`.
