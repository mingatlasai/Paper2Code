Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [configs/model/titan_multimodal.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/model/titan_multimodal.yaml)

It is fully config-bound to `config.yaml`, follows your fixed design/interfaces, avoids invented hyperparameters, and explicitly marks unresolved supplementary details as nullable/deferred.
