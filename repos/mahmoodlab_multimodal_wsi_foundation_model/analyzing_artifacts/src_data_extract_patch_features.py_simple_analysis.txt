Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/data/extract_patch_features.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/data/extract_patch_features.py).

It is fully focused on analysis (no code), aligned with:
- Paper methodology (512x512 @20x tiling, 768-d patch features, feature-space pipeline),
- Your design interface for `PatchFeatureExtractor`,
- `config.yaml` as source of truth (no invented hyperparameters),
- Artifact contracts required by downstream stages (`coords` + `features` with deterministic ordering and persistence).
