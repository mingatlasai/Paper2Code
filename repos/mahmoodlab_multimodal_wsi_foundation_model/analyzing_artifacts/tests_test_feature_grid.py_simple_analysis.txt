Implemented the requested logic analysis in [tests/test_feature_grid.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/tests/test_feature_grid.py).

It now contains an analysis-only test plan covering:
- coordinate-to-grid mapping correctness,
- valid/background mask consistency,
- stage-specific crop shape contracts (`16x16`, `64x64`),
- deterministic and seeded-random crop reproducibility,
- invalid-input failure cases aligned to config/design constraints.

No executable tests were added yet, and no test run was performed.
