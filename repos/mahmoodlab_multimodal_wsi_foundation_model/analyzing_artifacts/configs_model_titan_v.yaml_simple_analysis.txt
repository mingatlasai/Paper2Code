Implemented the logic analysis in:

- [configs/model/titan_v.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/model/titan_v.yaml)

It is YAML-valid and aligned to:
- the paper’s TITAN-V/stage-1 methodology,
- your fixed design interfaces (without adding new public methods),
- and only explicit values from `config.yaml` (with unresolved paper details kept explicitly unresolved).
