Added the Stage-2 logic analysis to [src/train/stage2_trainer.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/train/stage2_trainer.py).

It is aligned to the paper/design/config constraints and covers:
- Stage-2 role and interface contract
- Config-bound constants only (no invented hyperparameters)
- `train_step` flow for CoCa contrastive + caption objectives
- Effective batch arithmetic (`196 * 8 * 2 = 3136`)
- Stage-1 checkpoint initialization and Stage-3 handoff requirements
- Invariants, failure modes, and implementation checklist
