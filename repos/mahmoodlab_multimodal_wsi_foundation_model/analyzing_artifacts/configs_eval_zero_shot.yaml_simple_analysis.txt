Created the requested logic analysis in [configs/eval/zero_shot.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/eval/zero_shot.yaml).

It is structured to match your existing eval-analysis format and is strictly bound to the provided paper/design/task/config constraints, including:
- zero-shot inference equation and embedding normalization logic
- required design interfaces only (no extra public APIs)
- config-bound constants (e.g., 768-d embeddings, ViT 6/12/64/3072, patch size 512, 20x)
- prompt-ensemble handling, metric mapping, split/reporting rules
- fidelity checks, failure modes, unresolved supplementary gaps, and validation checklist
