Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [src/eval/zero_shot.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/eval/zero_shot.py)

It is now a structured, paper-aligned analysis covering prompt ensemble encoding, normalized cosine-similarity classification, balanced accuracy/AUROC reporting, interface constraints, config bindings from `config.yaml`, failure modes, and reproducibility requirements. I also verified the file parses successfully with `py_compile`.
