Updated the logic analysis in [configs/train/stage2_coca.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/train/stage2_coca.yaml).

It is now structured and paper-aligned for Stage 2 CoCa ROI-caption training, strictly bound to the provided `config.yaml`, and constrained to the exact design interfaces without introducing new APIs or invented hyperparameters.
