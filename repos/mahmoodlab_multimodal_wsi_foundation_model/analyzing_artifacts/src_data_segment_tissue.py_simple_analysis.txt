Updated the logic analysis in [src/data/segment_tissue.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/data/segment_tissue.py).

It now documents:
- Exact design-bound `TissueSegmenter` interface
- Paper-aligned segmentation flow (`HSV S-threshold -> median blur -> morphological closing -> contour area filtering`)
- Config alignment constraints (without inventing missing hyperparameters)
- Determinism, coordinate-space contracts, failure modes, and downstream integration requirements for tiling/grouping.
