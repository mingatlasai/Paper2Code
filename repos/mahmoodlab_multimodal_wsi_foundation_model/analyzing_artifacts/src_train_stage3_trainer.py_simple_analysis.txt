Added the Stage-3 logic analysis to:

- [src/train/stage3_trainer.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/train/stage3_trainer.py)

It is aligned to the paper/design/task/config constraints, preserves the exact public interface (`__init__`, `train_step`), uses only provided config values, and explicitly keeps unspecified hyperparameters as unresolved/config-driven.
