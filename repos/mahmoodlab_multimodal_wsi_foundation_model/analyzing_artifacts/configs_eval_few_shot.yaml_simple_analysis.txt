Completed. I wrote the requested logic analysis to:

[configs/eval/few_shot.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/configs/eval/few_shot.yaml)

It is config-bound to your `config.yaml`, follows the paper’s few-shot protocol (`K={1,2,4,8,16,32}`, `50` runs), adheres to the provided design interfaces, and avoids inventing missing supplementary hyperparameters.
