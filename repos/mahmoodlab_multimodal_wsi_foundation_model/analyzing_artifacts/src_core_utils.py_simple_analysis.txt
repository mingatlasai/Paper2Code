Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/core/utils.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/core/utils.py).

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned plan for `utils.py` covering:
- seeding and deterministic behavior
- distributed init/cleanup and rank-safe writes
- device/tensor helpers
- filesystem/path helpers
- checkpoint save/load/resume contract (`titan_v.ckpt`, `titan_stage2.ckpt`, `titan_final.ckpt`)
- JSON/CSV/JSONL artifact writers
- runtime metadata + reproducibility validation against `config.yaml`
- failure modes and stage-wise integration map
- minimal function inventory for implementation

No executable code was added yet, only analysis as requested.
