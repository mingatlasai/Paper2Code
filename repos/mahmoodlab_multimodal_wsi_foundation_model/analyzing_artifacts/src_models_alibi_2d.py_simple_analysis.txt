Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/models/alibi_2d.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/models/alibi_2d.py).

It is now a paper- and `config.yaml`-aligned specification for 2D ALiBi covering:
- Required class interface (`__init__`, `build_bias`, `apply`) per design
- Euclidean-distance ALiBi math contract
- Tensor shape contracts and broadcasting rules
- Validation/error-handling rules
- Numerical/performance considerations for long contexts
- Reproducibility constraints and unit-test mapping
- Explicit handling of unknown supplementary hyperparameters (kept configurable, not invented)
