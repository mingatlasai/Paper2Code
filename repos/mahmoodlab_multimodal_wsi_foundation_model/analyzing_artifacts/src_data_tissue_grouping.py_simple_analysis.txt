Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/data/tissue_grouping.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/data/tissue_grouping.py).

It is aligned to:
- paper methodology (spatial contour grouping + `<16` patch filtering),
- the fixed design interface for `TissueGrouper`,
- `config.yaml` constants (`patch_size=512`, stage-1 `16x16` region context),
- reproducibility constraints (determinism, metadata provenance, idempotent artifact writing),
- and explicit handling of under-specified paper details as config-driven unknowns.
