Implemented the requested logic analysis in [scripts/run_stage1.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/scripts/run_stage1.py).

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned orchestration spec for Stage-1 (`TITAN V`) covering:
- config binding to `config.yaml`,
- thin orchestrator scope and interface constraints,
- CLI override and merge policy,
- registry wiring,
- checkpoint resume semantics,
- stage invariants and failure handling,
- artifact/logging expectations,
- paper-fidelity guardrails.

No executable code was added yet, per your instruction.
