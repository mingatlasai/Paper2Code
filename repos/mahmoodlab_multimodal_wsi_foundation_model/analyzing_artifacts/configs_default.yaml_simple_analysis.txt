Implemented the logic analysis in:

- [configs/default.yaml](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/repos/mahmoodlab_multimodal_wsi_foundation_model_repo/configs/default.yaml)

It is fully structured around the paper, your design interfaces, task list, and `config.yaml` values only (with unresolved paper details explicitly marked as `null`/open items). YAML parsing was validated successfully.
