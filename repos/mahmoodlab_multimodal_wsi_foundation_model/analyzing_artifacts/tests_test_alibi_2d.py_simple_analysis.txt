Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [tests/test_alibi_2d.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/tests/test_alibi_2d.py)

It is analysis-only (no code), aligned to the paper, your design interfaces, and `config.yaml` (including 2D Euclidean ALiBi, 12 heads, and shape/monotonicity/integration validation scope).
