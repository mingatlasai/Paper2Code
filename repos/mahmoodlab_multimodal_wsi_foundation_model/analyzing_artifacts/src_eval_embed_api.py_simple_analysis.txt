Implemented the requested logic analysis in [src/eval/embed_api.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/eval/embed_api.py).

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned specification for the `EmbeddingService` interface, including:
- exact design-bound API contract
- config.yaml-bound constants and invariants
- centering + L2 normalization rules shared across eval tasks
- task-by-task integration expectations (linear/few-shot/zero-shot/retrieval/survival)
- error handling, reproducibility constraints, and guardrails against inventing missing hyperparameters.
