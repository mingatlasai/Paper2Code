Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [src/data/build_feature_grid.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/data/build_feature_grid.py)

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned analysis covering:
- sparse `(x, y, feat)` to dense 2D grid mapping,
- background/valid mask construction,
- stage-1 `16x16` and stage-3 `64x64` crop logic,
- strict config-bound invariants from `config.yaml`,
- failure modes, reproducibility constraints, and test implications.
