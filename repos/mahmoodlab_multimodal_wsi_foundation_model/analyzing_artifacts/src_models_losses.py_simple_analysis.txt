Implemented the logic analysis in [src/models/losses.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/models/losses.py).

It now provides a structured, paper-aligned spec for:
- `IBOTLoss` (design-locked API),
- stage-2/3 contrastive InfoNCE loss,
- stage-2/3 caption cross-entropy,
- combined weighted objectives with config-driven/fallback handling for missing supplementary hyperparameters.

No executable loss code was added yet, per your instruction.
