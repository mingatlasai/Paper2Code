Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- [src/core/config_schema.py](/Users/mingatlas/Projects/Paper2Code/src/core/config_schema.py)

It is analysis-only (no implementation code), and it covers:
- Typed config contract decomposition (`runtime/data/model/train/eval/experiment`)
- Exact bindings to provided `config.yaml`
- Cross-field validation logic and stage-compatibility checks
- Invariants, failure modes, and unresolved (nullable) paper details without inventing values.
