Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/data/patch_tiler.py`.

It now contains a detailed, paper- and config-aligned design analysis covering:
- exact preprocessing constraints (`20x`, `512x512`, `stride=512`, non-overlap),
- strict adherence to the required `PatchTiler` interface,
- coordinate generation and extraction contracts with `wsi_reader.py` and tissue masks,
- determinism, error handling, and reproducibility requirements,
- integration boundaries and non-goals for later coding.
