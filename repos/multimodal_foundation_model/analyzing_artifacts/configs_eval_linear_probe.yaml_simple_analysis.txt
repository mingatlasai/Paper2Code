Implemented the logic analysis in `configs/eval/linear_probe.yaml`.

It now encodes:
- Fixed linear probe settings from the paper/config (`C=0.5`, `lbfgs`, `max_iter=10000`, `class_weight=balanced`)
- Split/few-shot logic and leakage guardrails
- Task-to-metric routing (`macro_auc`, `balanced_accuracy`, `quadratic_weighted_kappa`)
- Fold aggregation/CI reporting and stats-test handoff
- Reproducibility and hard constraints for no-tuning evaluation
