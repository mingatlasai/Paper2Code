Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/models/losses.py`.

What was added:
- A full analysis-only module docstring for `ContrastiveLoss` aligned with the paper, design interfaces, task constraints, and provided `config.yaml`.
- Explicit contract coverage for:
  - `__init__(temperature: float, bidirectional: bool)`
  - `forward(z_wsi: object, z_mol: object) -> float`
- InfoNCE/bidirectional behavior, shape/pairing invariants, config binding rules, numerical stability, failure modes, and test guidance.
- Clear handling of unresolved paper details (temperature default not hardcoded).
