Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/data/manifest_schema.py`.

It now documents, in a paper/config-aligned way:

- Canonical `ManifestRecord` fields and meanings.
- Required vs conditional field rules (`rna_path`/`dna_path`).
- Patient-level aggregation invariant (union of patches across WSIs).
- Split/leakage guarantees tied to `sample_id`/`patient_id`.
- Task-label semantics and metric routing alignment.
- Public-only vs full-private compatibility without changing schema keys.
- Validation policy and implementation guardrails for later coding.

No executable schema code was added yet, per your instruction.
