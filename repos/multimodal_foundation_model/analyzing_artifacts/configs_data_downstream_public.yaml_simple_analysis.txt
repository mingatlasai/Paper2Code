Implemented `configs/data/downstream_public.yaml` with a full paper-aligned logic analysis for downstream evaluation.

What it now contains:
- Public-only reproduction scope and hard exclusions for private cohorts.
- Split policy for `official_single_fold`, `cv5_80_20`, and `mc50`, including few-shot (`k=[1,2,4,8,16,32]`) and BRACS exception handling.
- Patient grouping and aggregation rules aligned with THREADS (`union_of_patches_across_all_wsis` for patient-level).
- Metric routing (`macro_auc`, `balanced_accuracy`, `quadratic_weighted_kappa`, `c_index`, `map_at_k`).
- Linear probe and CoxNet fixed hyperparameters from `config.yaml`, including survival alpha overrides.
- Task registry by family with public cohorts and per-task split strategies.
- Transferability, retrieval, molecular prompting evaluation logic.
- Confidence interval and significance testing policy (ANOVA/Tukey, mixed-effects, bootstrap CI, log-rank).
