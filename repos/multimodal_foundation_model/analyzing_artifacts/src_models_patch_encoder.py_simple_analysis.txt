Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/models/patch_encoder.py`.

What I added:
- A full analysis docstring for the `PatchEncoder` and `ConchPatchEncoder` contracts.
- Strict alignment to your design interfaces (no extra public methods).
- Explicit references to `config.yaml` constraints:
  - 20x, 512 patch size/stride, no overlap
  - resize 512→448
  - ImageNet normalization
  - CONCHV1.5 adapter
  - patch feature dim 768 (downstream THREADS compatibility)
- Integration contracts with `src/data/patch_tiler.py`, `src/data/feature_store.py`, and `src/models/slide_encoder_threads.py`.
- Determinism/error handling/validation checklist for coding phase.
