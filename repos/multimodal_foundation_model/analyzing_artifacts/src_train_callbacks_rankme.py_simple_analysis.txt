Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/train/callbacks_rankme.py:1`.

What’s included in that file:
- Paper-aligned RankMe definition and checkpoint criterion.
- Exact warmup/start logic tied to `config.yaml` (`warmup_epochs=5`, `eps=1e-7`).
- Strict interface constraints matching your design (`__init__`, `compute_rankme`, `on_train_epoch_end` only).
- Runtime contract with `PretrainModule` for embedding snapshots.
- Numerical stability, DDP consistency, logging/artifact expectations, and failure handling.
- Conservative decisions for ambiguous paper details (strict improvement tie-break, rank-0 decision in DDP).
- Test expectations to guide implementation and verification later.
