Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/data/feature_store.py`.

It now documents, in paper/config-aligned detail, the intended behavior for persistent patch feature storage, including:
- exact design interface constraints,
- schema and invariants (`sample_id`, `coords`, `features`, `encoder_name`, `precision`),
- method-by-method logic (`write/read/exists/delete`),
- reproducibility and integrity rules,
- pipeline producer/consumer interactions,
- error model and coding-phase validation checklist.
