Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/core/registry.py`.

What’s included in `src/core/registry.py`:
- Registry responsibilities and scope aligned to the paper, plan, design, and `config.yaml`
- Exact factory targets based on the provided interfaces (no extra public APIs invented)
- Stage-aware assembly rules (`preprocess`, `pretrain`, `embed`, `eval`)
- Config-to-key resolution and normalization strategy
- Component-by-component construction constraints (THREADS, RNA, DNA, loss, evaluators)
- Paper-locked invariants and fail-fast rules for unknown/null hyperparameters
- Error model, reproducibility/audit requirements, and implementation/test sequencing

No executable registry code was added yet, only the structured analysis as requested.
