Implemented the logic analysis in `main.py` as requested.

- Added an analysis-only document that defines `main.py`’s CLI entrypoint responsibilities, dispatch flow, invariants from `config.yaml`, import boundaries, failure policy, reproducibility rules, and non-goals.
- Kept it aligned with the design contract (`MainApp`, `ExperimentConfig`) and stage runners (`preprocess`, `pretrain`, `embed`, `eval`).
- No executable code was added yet, per your instruction.
