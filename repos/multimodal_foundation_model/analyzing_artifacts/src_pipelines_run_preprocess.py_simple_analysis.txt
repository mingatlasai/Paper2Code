Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/pipelines/run_preprocess.py`.

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned orchestration spec for:
- WSI -> tissue mask -> 512x512@20x patches -> CONCHV1.5 features -> feature store
- strict config anchoring to `config.yaml`
- interface-constrained flow (matching your design)
- invariants, error handling, determinism, logging, and open decisions for coding phase

If you want, I can next produce the same analysis-first content for `src/pipelines/run_pretrain.py` and `src/pipelines/run_embed.py` in the same format.
