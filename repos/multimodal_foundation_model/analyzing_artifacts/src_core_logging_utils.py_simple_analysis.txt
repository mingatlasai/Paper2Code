Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/core/logging_utils.py` (file was missing, so I created it).

The file now contains a structured, paper-aligned specification for:

- unified logging responsibilities,
- run ID and artifact layout contracts,
- stage-specific logging requirements,
- W&B/MLflow integration behavior,
- DDP-safe logging rules,
- failure/resume semantics,
- cross-module contracts and validation checklist,

all grounded in your provided `config.yaml`, design interfaces, and task constraints.
