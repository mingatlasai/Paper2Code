Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/models/slide_encoder_threads.py`.

It now documents, without code, the full slide-encoder contract aligned with:
- the paper methodology,
- your fixed design interfaces,
- and `config.yaml` constraints (ABMIL gated attention, 2-head main setting, 1024-d output, mask-aware aggregation, integration points, validation and failure rules).
