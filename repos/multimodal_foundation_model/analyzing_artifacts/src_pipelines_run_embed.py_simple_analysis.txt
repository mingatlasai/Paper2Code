Created and filled `src/pipelines/run_embed.py` with a full analysis-only orchestration spec for the embed stage.

It now covers:
- paper/config-locked constraints (`1024` dim, all-patches export, patient union-of-patches, bf16 target),
- stage inputs/preconditions,
- end-to-end call flow using only design interfaces,
- invariants, failure policy, reproducibility controls, and downstream integration contracts.

No executable code was added.
