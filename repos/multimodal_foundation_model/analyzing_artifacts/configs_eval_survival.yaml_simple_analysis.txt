Implemented the logic analysis in `configs/eval/survival.yaml`.

What’s now in `configs/eval/survival.yaml`:
- Paper- and `config.yaml`-aligned CoxNet survival evaluation contract for `src/eval/survival_eval.py`
- Fixed defaults: `max_iter=10000`, `alpha` OS=`0.07`, PFS=`0.01`
- Task/model alpha overrides:
  - `CPTAC-CCRCC overall survival` + `CHIEF` -> `0.01`
  - `BOEHMK progression-free survival` + `PRISM` -> `0.02`
- Explicit alpha resolution order, split policy, leakage guardrails, metric routing (`c-index`), CI/aggregation rules, stats handoff, reproducibility constraints, and unresolved items

Validation:
- YAML parses successfully (`YAML_OK True`).
