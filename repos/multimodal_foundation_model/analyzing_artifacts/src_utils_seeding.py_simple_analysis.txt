Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/utils/seeding.py` (new file).

What I added:
- A full analysis-only specification for deterministic seed handling across Python/NumPy/Torch/DDP.
- Paper/config-aligned constraints and invariants from `config.yaml`.
- Required public interface contracts for seeding utilities.
- Stage-by-stage integration requirements for `main.py` and all pipelines.
- Determinism guardrails, failure modes, provenance logging requirements, and test expectations.

No executable code was added yet, consistent with your instruction.
