Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/data/wsi_reader.py`.

It now documents, in paper/config-aligned detail:

- Exact `WSIReader` interface responsibilities from your design (`open/read_region/get_mpp/close`)
- Magnification-aware reading constraints for `20x`, `512x512`, stride `512`, no overlap
- Metadata and coordinate contracts needed by `patch_tiler.py` and `tissue_segmenter.py`
- Error handling, determinism, resource-safety, and reproducibility expectations
- Clear boundaries so no design/interface drift is introduced
