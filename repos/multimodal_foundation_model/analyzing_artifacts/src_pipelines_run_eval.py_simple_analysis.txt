Implemented the requested logic analysis in:

- `src/pipelines/run_eval.py`

It now contains a full, paper-aligned orchestration plan for evaluation stage covering:

- split resolution (`official`/CV/MC/few-shot),
- embedding selection (slide vs patient),
- dispatch to linear probe / survival / retrieval / prompting evaluators,
- fixed hyperparameter and metric routing from `config.yaml`,
- statistical workflow (ANOVA → Tukey, mixed-effects, CI policy),
- reproducibility controls, guardrails, and public-only scope behavior.
