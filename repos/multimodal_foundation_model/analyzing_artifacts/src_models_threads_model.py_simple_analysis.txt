Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/models/threads_model.py`.

What it now contains:
- A full analysis-only specification for `ThreadsModel` (no executable code).
- Exact interface contract matching your design (`__init__`, `forward_wsi`, `forward_rna`, `forward_dna`, `training_step`, `extract_slide_embedding`).
- Paper/config-aligned behavior for:
  - 1024-d shared embedding space,
  - multimodal (WSI↔RNA/WSI↔DNA) contrastive pretraining,
  - modality-availability handling,
  - embedding export semantics.
- Explicit loss aggregation policy with uncertainty handling where paper details are unreadable.
- Validation, failure modes, integration boundaries, and reproducibility requirements.
