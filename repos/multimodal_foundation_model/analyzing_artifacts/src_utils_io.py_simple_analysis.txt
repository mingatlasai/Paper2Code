Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/utils/io.py`.

It now contains a structured, paper-aligned analysis for reusable I/O helpers covering:
- scope and module responsibilities,
- strict data contracts for manifest/splits/features/embeddings/metrics,
- config fidelity constraints from `config.yaml`,
- validation/error-handling/determinism policies,
- planned helper API surface (analysis-only, no implementation),
- testability and definition-of-done criteria.
