Updated `configs/default.yaml` with a full top-level logic analysis config that is:

- Hydra-composed via `defaults` importing `data`, `model`, `pretrain`, `train`, and `eval`
- Strictly aligned to the provided `config.yaml` and paper constraints
- Explicit about known unknowns (`null` for unreadable/unspecified hyperparameters)
- Structured for all stages (`preprocess`, `pretrain`, `embed`, `eval`)
- Backward-safe by keeping both `runtime.stage` and `runtime.mode`
