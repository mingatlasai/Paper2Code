Added the requested logic analysis to `tests/test_split_manager.py`.

It now documents, in paper/config-aligned detail, the unit-test logic for:
- patient-stratified split correctness,
- leakage prevention checks,
- few-shot derivation consistency,
- deterministic reproducibility,
- official split schema/roundtrip validation,
- edge/failure cases.
