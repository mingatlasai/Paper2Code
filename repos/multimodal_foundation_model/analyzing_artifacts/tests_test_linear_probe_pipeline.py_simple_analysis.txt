Implemented the requested logic analysis in `tests/test_linear_probe_pipeline.py`.

It now documents, in paper/config-aligned detail, the smoke-test logic for:
- exported embeddings + split compatibility,
- metric validity and routing,
- deterministic behavior with fixed seeds,
- leakage and schema invariants,
- few-shot/test-set consistency,
- strict fixed linear-probe hyperparameters (`C=0.5`, `lbfgs`, `max_iter=10000`, `class_weight=balanced`).
