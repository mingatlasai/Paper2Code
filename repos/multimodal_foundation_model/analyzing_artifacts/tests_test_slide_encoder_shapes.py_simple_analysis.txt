Implemented the requested logic analysis in `tests/test_slide_encoder_shapes.py`.

What I wrote there:
- A paper/config-aligned unit-test specification for `ThreadsSlideEncoder`.
- Exact interface constraints from your design (`__init__`, `forward`, `attention_weights` only).
- Shape and invariant requirements for single-head (`n_heads=1`) and main multi-head (`n_heads=2`) modes.
- Masking correctness expectations (masked patch attention suppression, valid-token normalization).
- Negative/error-case expectations for invalid ranks and mismatched dimensions.
- A concrete test matrix naming intended test cases and assertions.

No executable tests were added yet, only the analysis blueprint as requested.
