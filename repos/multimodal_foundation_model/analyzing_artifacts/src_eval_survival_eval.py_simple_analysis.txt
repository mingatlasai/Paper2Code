Added the requested logic analysis to `src/eval/survival_eval.py`.

It is now a structured, analysis-only specification covering:
- exact `SurvivalEvaluator` interface constraints from the design,
- CoxNet config fidelity (`max_iter=10000`, OS/PFS alpha defaults + overrides),
- split and data contracts with `SplitManager`,
- fold execution flow, c-index scoring, CI aggregation rules,
- guardrails, reproducibility requirements, and unresolved ambiguities.

No code execution/tests were run since this change is documentation-only.
