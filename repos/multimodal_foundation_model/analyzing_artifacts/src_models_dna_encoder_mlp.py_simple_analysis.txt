Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/models/dna_encoder_mlp.py`.

It is now a paper-aligned, config-bound blueprint (no executable code yet) covering:
- Exact interface contract from design (`DNAMLPEncoder.__init__`, `forward`)
- Required dimensions and defaults from `config.yaml` (`1673 -> 1024`, dropout `0.2`)
- Internal 4-layer MLP logic and validation rules
- Integration contracts with `threads_model`, datamodules, and losses
- Failure modes, reproducibility constraints, and coding-phase test checklist.
