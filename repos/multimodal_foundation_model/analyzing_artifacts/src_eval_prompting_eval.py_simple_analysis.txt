Implemented the logic analysis in `src/eval/prompting_eval.py`.

It now documents, in analysis-only form, the full paper-faithful prompting logic for:
- molecular class prototype construction,
- nearest-prompt classification with L2 distance,
- survival risk prompting using top/bottom 25% uncensored support groups,
- strict interface compliance with `PromptingEvaluator`,
- config-grounded constraints and guardrails for reproducibility/leakage.
