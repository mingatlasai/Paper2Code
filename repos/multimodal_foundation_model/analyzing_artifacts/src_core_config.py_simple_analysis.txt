Implemented the requested logic analysis in `src/core/config.py`.

What I added in `src/core/config.py`:
- A full analysis blueprint for the Hydra/OmegaConf loader + validation layer.
- Exact `ExperimentConfig` interface contract aligned to design (`from_yaml`, `validate`, `to_dict`).
- Stage normalization/dispatch logic (`preprocess|pretrain|embed|eval`).
- Paper-locked invariant checks tied to provided `config.yaml` values only.
- Cross-config consistency checks (shared constants, schema contracts, patient aggregation rule).
- Typed getter plan for downstream pipelines.
- Error model and failure behavior.
- Handling policy for unresolved paper values (`null`, no silent guessing).
- Public-only reproduction guardrails and expected test behaviors.
